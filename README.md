# Boston_Hacks_2019
Gesture Recognition with template matching via opencv and Leap_Motion Controller to Control the Bose SoundTouch 10 


Note: gesture_track.py 
Make sure that your Bose SoundTouch 10 is connected, and change the IP address inside this file to the IP address of your Bose SoundTouch 10.
After which, run the gesture_track file, where there exists a large background contrast. I.E. where the background is black and with little
light. Make certain gestures to control the functionality of your Bose speaker. 

Note: Leap Motion Controller 
In order to run this, you will need python 2.7.7 since I used the Leap-Motion Controller. First make sure that your Leap-Motion controller 
is connected. In the file leap_motion, change the Hardcoded IP address to the Ip address of your Bose SoundTouch 10. Run the file hacks.py
and this will alert the Leap-motion controller to start picking up data. Make certain suggestions to control the functionality of your Bose Speaker. 

Gestures include: 
Pinching with left hand to play/ pause music.
Swiping with your left hand to increase volume of the speaker by 10 units. 
Swiping with your right hand to decrease the volume of the speaker by 10 units. 
With your right hand, extend your finger and make a clockwise rotation to skip to the next song. 
With your right hand, extend your finger and make a counterclockwise rotation to move to the previous song.
